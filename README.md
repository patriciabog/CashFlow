# CashFlow

This is my first project with Vue JS, the experience was great to introduce to this framework.

This web app has been created to assist with finance management by recording all income and expenses over a span of three months. The graphic displays the changes over time. By clicking the orange button, users can add a new transaction using a form. Clicking on the final line allows users to view all transactions in red if the amount is negative (-0) or in green if it is positive (0+). Additionally, users can delete transactions using the trash icon.
